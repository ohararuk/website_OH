##  Overview:
The Ecoinformatics Lab at the University of Central Florida invites applications for a postdoctoral researcher with an interest in soil carbon dynamics modelling. Soil carbon dynamics has been an important and a challenging component in carbon cycle models, and this position will provide an opportunity to advance the understanding of soil carbon dynamics through model-driven hypothesis testing. The successful candidate will have detailed knowledge of the latest advances in carbon cycle dynamics theory, expertise in computational methods, and model evaluation. Preference will be given to candidates with experience in application of data model fusion techniques. The position will be located at the main UCF campus near Orlando, Florida.  

## Major Duties/Responsibilities:

*	build models of soil carbon dynamics and implement them in R/Python;  
*	parameterize models using observations from litter manipulation experiments using data-model fusion techniques;  
*	analyze model output and performance;  
*	publish research in peer-reviewed journals and present results at national and international conferences.    



## Basic Requirements:  

*	a Ph.D. degree in Ecosystem Ecology, Earth System Science, Geography, or a related field;  
*	experience in biogeochemical model application and analysis;  
*	ability to collaborate effectively in a team environment;  
*	excellent written and oral communication skills.  

## Desired Skills:

*	experience with application of data-model fusion techniques (e.g. Ensemble Kalman Filter, Bayesian inversion);  
*	ability to pursue research independently.  


## Application Instructions:  

Applicants should submit

1. a one-page statement research interests and your qualifications for the position;  
2. a current CV; and  
3. three letters of reference (sent directly to [Dr. Sasha Hararuk](mailto:ohararuk@ucf.edu)).  

Review of applications will begin on June 15, 2019 and will continue until the position is filled. The position is intended to be for two years with initial appointment for one year and renewal assuming satisfactory performance. The rate of pay is $50,000 per year.
